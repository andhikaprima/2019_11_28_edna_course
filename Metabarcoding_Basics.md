# Metabarcoding Basics

Most metabarcoding pipelines and software use similar tools and methodological approaches, and there are a common set of file types. The methods and the underlying concepts will be presented as we go through the example sets, but to start off, here we introduce a basic tool kit for metabarcoding (aside from the specific software packages themselves), and review the basic file types and formats that will be used for this course, and for most metabarcoding. If you have a firm grasp of these files, then it will be easier to transform your data so it can be used with almost any metabarcoding software package. We will be using Qiime2 for most examples, but we will also show examples of how outputs from other programs can be imported and processed, or just visualised, using Qiime2.
